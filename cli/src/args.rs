//! Clap argument and subcommand definitions for the `living-docs` CLI.
//!
//! Docblocks on each verb document its mechanics for a reader of this file;
//! they are no longer the help text (ADR 0060). `--help` comes from the
//! explicit `about`/`after_help` attributes in `args/help.rs`, one short
//! line plus a real `Examples:` block per verb. The root `--help`'s verb
//! listing is grouped into Authoring (`new`, `set`, `supersede`, `index`,
//! `fmt`), Gate (`check`), Reading (`read`, `guide`), and Distribution
//! (`install`, `uninstall`, `completions`) by `help::root_command_template`
//! — clap's `next_help_heading` groups an individual subcommand's own args,
//! not sibling subcommands, so it cannot do this grouping itself.
