## Identity cannot express an author-named record in a directory

Follow-up from [ADR 0027](/adr/0027-every-rule-keyed-by-doc-type-becomes-a-registry-field-and-glossary-is-not-a-doc-type.md).

`DocTypeSpec::identity` has two variants. `Numbered { dir }` places a record in a
directory under an `NNNN` prefix the tool allocates. `Singleton { file }` places it at one
fixed path. A third shape exists in the corpus and neither variant fits it: a record that
lives in a directory, has many peers, and is named by its author rather than numbered by
the tool.

Three shipped artifacts are waiting on it. The `glossary` template declares
`type: Context` and is one vocabulary group file among many — `context/glossary.md` and
`context/billing.md` are peers, not a first and a second. The `Context` family generally,
and the `Architecture View` family behind `architecture-index.md`, have the same shape.
All three are hand-copied today: there is no `living-docs new` verb that produces them,
which is the gap ADR 0026 closed for `constitution` and left open here.

The cost of the gap is not only ergonomic. A hand-copied record starts outside the
canonical-frontmatter invariant and outside index membership, so the two checks that keep
the numbered types honest do not apply to it.

### Scope

Included: a third `Identity` variant for author-named records in a directory, and
whatever `new`, `index`, `check` and the web front need in order to honor it. Wiring the
`glossary` template as the first row that uses it.

Explicitly kept: `Numbered` and `Singleton` keep their current meaning and their current
rows. This adds a variant; it does not reshape the two that exist.

Explicitly out: `architecture-index.md` and `context-index.md` stay unwired regardless.
Both declare themselves OKF reserved `index.md` files carrying no frontmatter — they
scaffold a directory and are not records, so no identity variant applies to them.

### Acceptance

- `DOC_TYPES` contains a `glossary` row, and `living-docs new glossary "..."` — or
  whatever naming the design settles on — produces a record that `living-docs check`
  passes without hand-editing.
- The record produced is subject to the canonical-frontmatter invariant and to whatever
  index rule the design chooses, and a test pins which of the two applies.
- Fitness function: the check layer learns the new variant from the registry, in the shape
  `is_bundle_singleton` already uses — adding a second author-named row requires no edit
  inside `check`.
- `living-docs check docs` and `living-docs check examples/linkly/docs` stay green.

### Plan

Design first: an ADR settling what the tool owns for an author-named record. The open
questions are the naming rule (does the tool derive the filename from the title, or accept
it verbatim?), index membership (is a `Context` group file listed in an index the tool
regenerates, given that `context-index.md` is authored prose rather than a generated
listing?), and whether `type:` collision matters now that two rows could share one
frontmatter value — `spec_for` and `spec_for_dir` key on token and directory, so nothing
resolves a spec from its frontmatter value today, but that is an unstated invariant rather
than a guaranteed one.

Then one slice per question the ADR closes, in the order registry variant → `new` →
`check`, so each is demoable on its own.
