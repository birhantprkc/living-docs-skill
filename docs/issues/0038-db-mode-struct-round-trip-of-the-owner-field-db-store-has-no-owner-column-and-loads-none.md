## db-mode struct round-trip of the owner field: db-store has no owner column and loads None

Follow-up to [ADR 0043](/adr/0043-owner-is-a-cli-owned-frontmatter-field-with-a-warn-then-error-ratchet-on-adr-and-bdr.md). The owner field entered TYPED_FRONTMATTER_KEYS (excluded from the EAV frontmatter tail), but db-store has no typed owner column, so `load_record` fills `ExtractedRecord::owner` with `None`.

The gap is struct-level only: `check` and the `owner` verb read raw record text via `store.read()`, so no write path drops an existing owner value. What breaks is any consumer of the typed struct in db-mode, and ADR 0043's export round-trip fitness for db-authoritative deployments.

### Scope

- Add an `owner` column to the db-store records schema via a new migration; populate it on sync and authoring writes; read it in `load_record`.
- Extend the export round-trip suite so a db-mode record with owner materializes it byte-identically.
- KEPT: TYPED_FRONTMATTER_KEYS membership; fs-mode behavior unchanged.

### Acceptance

- A record synced with `owner: alice` loads with `owner == Some("alice")` in db-mode and exports byte-identically.
- Existing db-store tests stay green; the migration applies cleanly on both engines.

### Plan

1. Migration + entity column, sync/authoring write paths.
2. `load_record` read + round-trip test extension.
