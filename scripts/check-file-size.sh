# check-file-size.sh — enforce the 300-line file-size ratchet (issue 0028, CLAUDE.md rule 5).
#
# Every .rs file must stay at or under 300 lines. A file already over the limit when the
# ratchet was introduced is grandfathered in scripts/file-size-baseline.txt at its measured
# line count — it may shrink freely but never grow past that baseline, and once it drops to
# 300 lines or fewer the entry must be removed (the file leaves the list permanently, it
# never re-enters). A baseline entry for a file that no longer exists is stale and fails.
#
# .claude/worktrees/ holds other agents' parallel git worktrees (separate branches, sharing
# this repo's objects). Their .rs files are not part of this checkout's canonical tree, so
# counting them would make the gate's outcome depend on which worktrees happen to exist at
# run time — the opposite of deterministic. They are excluded the same way target/ is.
#
# Usage:  check-file-size.sh
# Exit:   0 = no violations, 1 = at least one violation.
