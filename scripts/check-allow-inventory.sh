# check-allow-inventory.sh — enforce the shrink-only allow-inventory gate (issue 0028 R3b).
#
# Every #[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)] annotation is inventoried in
# scripts/allow-inventory-baseline.txt at the count measured when the lint was enabled. A
# file may remove annotations (shrink toward zero) but never gain one: a file not on the
# baseline that carries an annotation fails, and a listed file whose count grows past its
# baseline fails. Once a listed file's count reaches zero, the function was fixed — the
# baseline entry is stale and must be removed, so a zero count still fails until then. A
# baseline entry for a file that no longer exists is stale and fails.
#
# .claude/worktrees/ holds other agents' parallel git worktrees; their .rs files are
# excluded the same way target/ is (see check-file-size.sh for the same rationale).
#
# Usage:  check-allow-inventory.sh
# Exit:   0 = no violations, 1 = at least one violation.
